When grabbed by zombie, fastest way to get off is another player shooting it
Other players have high health

Infection levels:
0 - None
1 - Noises
2 - Fake zombies only client can see, not real dissapear on shot or grab
3 - Fake invincible zombies on client only, grab player for 3 seconds (no damage or infection). Other players see struggle with no zombies
4 - When looking away and back towards a player, they look like a zombie. When shot, glitches back to normal player.
6 - Turn into a zombie? Run out of bullets, have to meele/knife only, but you're actually killing your team mates who look like zombies. On others screen, looks like you're biting them
