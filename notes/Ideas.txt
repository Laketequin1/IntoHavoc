Tame Zombies
Hallucinating / Knife
Seperate bar for infection level and health?
Mirrors? Reflect player state/health
HUD with seperate shader? Highlight player and enemys, maybe health popups??

When grabbed by zombie, fastest way to get off is another player shooting it
Other players have high health

In game proxy voice chat.

Infection levels:
0 - None
1 - Noises
2 - Fake zombies only client can see, not real dissapear on shot or grab
3 - Fake invincible zombies on client only, grab player for 3 seconds (no damage or infection). Other players see struggle with no zombies
4 - When looking away and back towards a player, they look a lot like a zombie. When shot, glitches back to normal player. Voice chat starts becoming muted, and losing direction.
6 - Turn into a zombie? Run out of bullets, have to meele/knife only, but you're actually killing your team mates who look like zombies. Vague voice chat, and directionless audio. On others screen, looks like you're biting them.
